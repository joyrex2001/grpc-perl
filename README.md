# Grpc::XS / grpc-perl

## Overview

This repository contains source code for a perl 5 implementation of gRPC
transport layer. It binds to the official shared C library. The implementation
is heavily based on the php implementation of the [gRPC library](https://grpc.io).

## Usage

This implementation only implements the grpc client, not the server. This
library also only implements the transport layer and is not intended to be used
directly. Instead it should be used in combination with a protocol buffer
implementation that support service rpc definitions. Currently the excellent
[Google::ProtocolBuffers::Dynamic](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Google-ProtocolBuffers-Dynamic/)
module is the best option for this.

#### `fork()` compatibility

It's possible to fork processes which use `Grpc::XS`, but only if this
library is used exclusively inside child processes. This requires an
explicit (de)initialization, otherwise things will hang forever on
very first attemp to use anything grpc-related. Here is how it can be
done:

```perl
Gprc::XS::destroy();
if (fork() == 0) { # in child
	Grpc::XS::init();
	# Grpc::XS can be used in this child without any problems
}
```

## Installation

On Ubuntu it requires the `libgrpc-dev` package so:

sudo apt-get install libgrpc-dev
