=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the low-level binding to the L<grpc|https://grpc.io> library.
This implementation only supports a grpc client.

This library is not intended to be used directly, but rather
in combination with a protocol buffer implementation like the
L<Google::ProtocolBuffers::Dynamic> module.
